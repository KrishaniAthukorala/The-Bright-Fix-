This cartoon depicts a story built around a tortoise who lives a monotonous life in the forest. In this story, the tortoise helps ants and it is the happiest moment of his day. Through this gentle story, young children are reminded that joy can be found in small moments and that having at least one happy memory every day is the key to living life with a happy heart.
